      Our goal is to make you have more Bitcoin.

      Instead of buying BTC based on gut feeling, or simple dollar cost averaging, dcaBTC provides you with backtested statistics and automated strategies that enable you to time your Bitcoin purchases correctly.

      In our tool, you wonâ€™t find vanity metrics like "Number of Bitcoin mentions on Twitter".

      All metrics have been elaborately backtested to make sure they give you a strong edge over other Bitcoin holders.
